## Essential HTML Elements
### DocType Setter `<!DOCTYPE html>`

### Paragraph `<p>`
The HTML \<p\> element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
### Main Heading `<h1>`
The HTML \<h1\> element represents the main heading. They are usually used only once, to display as a large "title" (not to be confused with the `head.title` element)
### Other Headings `<h2>`-`<h6>`
The HTML \<h1\>â€“\<h6\> elements represent six levels of section headings. \<h1\> is the highest section level and \<h6\> is the lowest.
```html
<h1>Beetles</h1>
  <h2>External morphology</h2>
  <h3>Head</h3>
    <h4>Mouthparts</h4>
  <h3>Thorax</h3>
    <h4>Prothorax</h4>
    <h4>Pterothorax</h4>
```
